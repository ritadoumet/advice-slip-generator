# advice-slip-generator
 This website generates a random piece of advice when you click on the dice button. It uses the Advice Slip JSON API.
 <h2>Overview</h2>
 This is my first ever project using APIs. I learned how to call an API and handle the JSON file returned in JavaScript.
 <br>It was an extremely fun project to work on.
 <br>It is responsive, and optimized for desktop screens and phone screens. 
 <br>The website took me around 1.5 hours of coding, and I consider it to be a fun little addition to my (yet to be developed) portfolio.
